##Preferred Workflow:

1. For every feature, create a new branch _(preferred, not required)_
2. Write codes ONLY in feature branch _(new or old feature branch)_
3. The continuous integration system will automatically build and test with our written tests for the new commits.
4. After passing the test, file a __pull request__
